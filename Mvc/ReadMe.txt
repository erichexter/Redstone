MagLev - a solution template to build ASP.Net MVC applications quickly and simply.

    MagLev provides a solution template which allows you to start developing features rather 
than setting up infrastructure like databases, unit testing, logging, error handling.

This solution is opinionated! We value the SOLID object oriented design principles, 
which are: SRP, OCP, LSP, ICP, DIP http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)

We also value limiting the number of abstractions in other words, we want to keep it cool and simple.
